# Agile In The Workplace
## Synopsis
We've made great progress toward becoming web developers over the past seven weeks. Our technical skills are growing. However, a major part of software development is the process - from client meetings, to code reviews. This week, we're going to learn about the agile development process through working on a project that has a Product Owner. We'll also start learning about deliverability of code, particularly code quality. 

## Agile Development
Agile software development is the overarching term for an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It places emphasis on frequent team communication and heavy collaboration, and encourages flexibility and quickness. It was originally introduced in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) in 2001. 

## Agile in Response
Agile Software Development was created as a lightweight alternative in response to heavyweight traditional software development, called waterfall. 

## Pivotal Tracker
[Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) is an agile project management tool that provides organization for software teams. Typically, a product owner will create user stories that are put in a backlog. Then, at the beginning of every sprint, stories are moved into the current section and given difficulty grades. Pivotal Tracker keeps track of how many stories (and of what difficulty) are finished per sprint and automatically calculates a velocity, informing the size of future sprints.
