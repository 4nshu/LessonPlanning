# Ruby Review & Advanced Ruby, Start with CS fundamentals


##Review:
We will revisit programming fundamentals and the way they are handled in Ruby.


####Lecture Outline
1. IRB
2. Data Types
3. Conditionals
4. Blocks
5. User Input
6. Objects
7. Classes
8. Instances
9. Class & Instance Methods
10. Inheritance
11. State
12. Object Orientation
13. Return Values
14. SOLID


####Lesson
Write a program in Ruby that will help us create highly secure communications, by encrypting things in pig latin! Use the [pig latin spec](../../lessons/pig_latin_spec.rb) Rspec file as your guide and measure of success for this exercise.


##Advanced Ruby:
In this section, we will move beyond basic programming and explore Ruby-specific tools and techniques.


####Lecture Outline
1. The object model in depth
2. Blocks, Procs, & Lambdas
3. Dynamic Classes & Methods
4. Missing Methods
5. DSL
6. Exception Handling
7. Symbols, THreads, & Fibers
8. Modules & Mixins
9. Files
10. Regular Expressions
11. Meta-programming


####Lesson

##CS Fundamentals - Part 1
Starting from week 9 we will each week include some data structures & algorithm introductions. The idea is to present one (or more) data structures during a lession, as well as one sort or search algorithm. The algorithm should then be implemented in Ruby as exercise. The next day the implementations of the algorithm will be discussed and compared (for example run time).

The first part of the CS Fundamentals consists of an intro into data structures, into algorithms in general, and into Big O Notation.

###Lesson

Intro into Data Structures: primitive data types, data structures, why does it matter?

Intro into Algorithms: What kind of algorithms are there (sort, search, etc.), why does it matter?

Intro into Big O Notation: How are algorithms evaluated? Why are some better than others? And again, why does it matter?
