#Test::Unit
  Test::Unit is a testing framework that comes prepackaged with Rails.  Test::Unit works well for testing individual methods or small chunks of code to make sure that they are working as the programmer expects.  Tests written in Test::Unit are based on assertions about how a particular method might behave.  If the assertions turn out to be true, the tests pass.  Pretty simple.
