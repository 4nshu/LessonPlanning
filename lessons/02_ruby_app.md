# A Pure-Ruby Application

## Overview
As web developers, we rarely get to work in Ruby only - often, we're using web frameworks like Rails. This is our change to write an all-ruby program!

## Beginning Rails - Chapter 4
We'll use Chapter Four of Beginning Ruby to help us with our application. In it, Peter describes a text analysis application. Walk through the chapter (you already know a lot of it).  

- Work with a partner
- First analyze Oliver Twist, as suggested
- Your application should have: character count (inc. and exc. spaces), word count, line count, sentence count, paragraph count, average number of words per sentence, average number of sentences per paragraph
- Then, work through the extra features (% of "useful" words and summary by "interesting" sentences)
- Find your favorite old-school book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and analyze it
- Write at least 3 of your own metrics to include in your application
