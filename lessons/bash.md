# Bash
A Shell is a command-line tool for operating a computer. Most of us are used to GUI based operating systems, but a command-line approach can be much more effective for many tasks in programming. Bash is a UNIX Shell (**B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell), it's the default shell for Linux and OS X, and has been ported to Windows with [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com). Many of the functions and tools needed for Ruby development will be executed from bash.
