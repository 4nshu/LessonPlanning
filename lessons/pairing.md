# Pairing
Pair programming is a common practice in agile software development. Pair programming is simply 2 people, sitting side-by-side working on the same piece of code on a single computer. Some common reasons for pair programming are:

- Productivity is limited by our minds not our hands
- One person can be editing code while the others mind is looking into future problems and strategic direction
- A more diverse thought process for every problem
- Less "good enough" code
- Both programmers will learn from each others practices

Studies have shown that while pair programming slows down production time (compared to two independent programmers), code quality is increased a non-trivial amount. While pair programming traditionally happens side-by-side, remote pair programming can be accomplished with the use of screen sharing.

Pair programming is a social practice and can present a few hurdles with coordination and cooperation. A couple things to keep in mind:

1. Pair programmers are equals, even if one developer has more experience both developers should be given equal opportunity for input and practice (pair programming and mentor/student programming are much different)
2. If a difference of opinion arises try agreeing on a point of return with one approach, to start the second approach.
3. Everyone's styles and practices are different, if you believe yours is "correct", clearly explain why you think so.
4. Be awesome to your fellow coders

Many employers will require pair programming, even as much as 100% of the time, but typically it is optional. Students will be practicing pair programming for many of the projects during ADA with fellow students, instructors, mentors, and potential employers.
