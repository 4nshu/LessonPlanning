# Beginning Ruby

## Overview
In this lesson we will be using the most basic classes in ruby. This lesson will serve as a way to acquaint ourselves with common ruby methods, practices, and to study the structure and usage of the language. After this lesson you should be familiar with Strings, Integers, Arrays, and Hashes. As well as have a basic understanding of the idea of Objects.

## History
Ruby was first launched in 1995 by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto "Yukihiro Matsumoto - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")  and has grown consistently since. Ruby version 2.0 was in 2013, which is intended to be fully backward compatiable with version 1.9.3. Many of the design concepts were taken from [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) and [SmallTalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). One of the unique things about Ruby is the core cultural principles associated with the language, much of which was influenced by Matsumoto (or Matz). Matz beleives that programming should be fun and focused on ease for humans.

>"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, 'By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.' They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves." *-Matz*

## Ruby in IRB
Ruby can be directly executed in a bash window using IRB (**I**nteractive **R**u**b**y). This can be a helpful tool for learning, quick computations, documentation, and debugging problems. 

- Arithmetic
- Basic string manipulation
- True, False, and Nil
- Arrays

## Ruby Scripts
Ruby can also be executed by using a script (file) by using the `ruby` command line tool. In a bash window you can type `ruby -h` to see the usage and a list of options for the `ruby` tool. The most basic usage would be `ruby [filename]`, doing so will execute the contents of the file.

- `puts`
- `if`, `else`, `end`
- blocks: `while` & `each`
- user input
- Hashes

## Ruby Structure
Understanding the core concepts of programming languages can be the most challenging part. We will spend a good deal of time learning the fundamental ideas and structure that surround the most basic ruby usage. Programming languages can be quite difficult to grasp, not because they over overly complex, but because they are abstract ideas. If we can understand how ruby works we can certainly be more effective in writing ruby code.

- Object Orientation: What is an object?
- Classes
- Instances
- Class Methods
- Instance Methods
- Inheritance
- State
