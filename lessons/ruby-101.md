# Beginning Ruby

## Overview
In this lesson we will be using the most basic classes in ruby. This lesson will serve as a way to acquaint ourselves with common ruby methods, practices, and to study the structure and usage of the language. After this lesson you should be familiar with Strings, Integers, Arrays, and Hashes. As well as have a basic understanding of the idea of Objects.

*note: Students should already have their environments set up. This should be a verification step.*

## Ruby in IRB
Ruby can be directly executed in a bash window using IRB (**I**nteractive **R**u**b**y). This can be a helpful tool for learning, quick computations, documentation, and debugging problems. 

- Arithmetic
- Basic string manipulation
- True, False, and Nil
- Arrays

## Ruby Scripts
Ruby can also be executed by using a script (file) by using the `ruby` command line tool. In a bash window you can type `ruby -h` to see the usage and a list of options for the `ruby` tool. The most basic usage would be `ruby [filename]`, doing so will execute the contents of the file.

- `puts`
- `if`, `else`, `end`
- blocks: `while` & `each`
- user input
- Hashes

## Ruby Structure
Understanding the core concepts of programming languages can be the most challenging part. We will spend a good deal of time learning the fundamental ideas and structure that surround the most basic ruby usage. Programming languages can be quite difficult to grasp, not because they over overly complex, but because they are abstract ideas. If we can understand how ruby works we can certainly be more effective in writing ruby code.
