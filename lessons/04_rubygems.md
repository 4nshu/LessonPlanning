# RubyGems

## Overview
RubyGems are like little (or sometimes BIG) bundles of Ruby. They can add any and all code to your ruby toolkit. Ruby provides many classes such as Strings, Arrays, Integers, and Hashes, but imagine that you often find yourself using Addresses in Ruby, you could write a gem that encompasses the attributes of an address, bundle it in a gem and reuse it in different application, and distribute it to any one in the world via rubygems.org.
