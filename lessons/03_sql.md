# SQL

## Overview and SQLite Installation
Begin reading the section on Relational Databases and SQL starting on page 228 of Beginning Ruby. It'll talk about MySQL, PostgresQL, Oracle (rarely used), and SQLite. 

Verify you have SQLite installed by using the quick Ruby script found on page 230. 

## Playing with SQLite Directly
It's worth it to know some SQL commands and be comfortable working with the database directly. Use the instructions starting on page 231 to create your own `test.db` - then, create a table and play with inserting, selecting, deleting, and updating records. 

## Ruby and the Database
Once you feel comfortable working with the sqlite command-line client, `.quit` will allow you to exit and move on. Use the instructions on page 236 to begin walking through creating a command-line ruby script that will write to a new database. Switch and have a partner add and search for people.
