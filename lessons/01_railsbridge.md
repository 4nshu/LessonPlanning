# Your First Application

## Overview
We're going to jump right into Rails, creating a basic version of the applications you'll be expert with at the end of class. We'll move quickly and it's totally okay to not understand at this point. We're starting to create the muscle memory for standard commands that you'll need to know to become a developer.

## RailsBridge
We'll be using the [RailsBridge](http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/) curriculum for our first program - Suggestotron. Even if you've done this before, walking through it a second time reinforces what you've learned and opens doors to new questions and challenges. For the rest of the day, we'll be using the tutorial right from the RailsBridge site.
