# Git
We will use Git, which is a distributed version control system, to track files and changes to code. Version control is a system that records changes to a set of files, to form a history of all of the changes. Each set of tracked files is called a repository or repo. Git allows us to distribute repos to remote servers for collaboration on projects. Git uses "branches" to keep multiple versions of code in parallel.

## Github
Github.com is a web service to host and manage git repositories. After a git repository is created locally a remote repo can be created on github. Or, if collaborating on somebody else's project a repo can be cloned directly from github.
