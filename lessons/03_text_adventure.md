# Building a Dungeon Text Adventure Game

## Overview
Beginning Ruby page 149 explains a text adventure game that highlights all the things you've learned about object orientation. Here's a real world example where you can put your new knowledge to use!

Walk through the instructions with a partner, and work together to make the game your own. The book describes a Dungeon class with Rooms, but maybe your game is Supermarket Sweep and has a GroceryStore with Aisles.

## Goal
Complete a full-fledged game for other teams to play. We'll review some of them together in class!
