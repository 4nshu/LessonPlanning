# RSpec
  RSpec is a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests in Rails.  It is flexible enough to accomodate granular unit tests or high-level behavior tests.  It is also expressive enough to be understood by non-programmers.  This makes RSpec a useful bridge language between developers and non-technical project managers or clients that allows each party to communicate and agree on how an application should behave.
