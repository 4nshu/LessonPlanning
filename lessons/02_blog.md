# Your Rails Blog

## Overview
The original introduction to Rails, and one of the reasons it skyrocketed to infamy, was that its creator, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), did a demo of creating a blog with Rails in 2006. At that time, building custom rails applications took hours, if not days, of customization. DHH showed that he could build a basic Rails blog in 15 minutes, which blew the minds of web developers at the time. 

## Our Blog
We'll build off of what we learned with last week's Suggestotron and build our own blogs (though they'll take a bit longer than 15 minutes). This will be a living project that you'll grow throughout the next 23 weeks - from design to content, it should be all yours and showcase your new skills and talents. 

## Blogger
We'll work through [JumpStart Lab's Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).
