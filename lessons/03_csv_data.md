# Introduction to Databases

## Overview
So far, we've only lightly touched on data stored in our applications. Big web applications rely heavily on databases, which store an incredible amount of information. Think about how Amazon might store all of the products in their web store - mind boggling.

Luckily for us, we're already familiar with data storage - we've all used spreadsheets before. We can use a csv (comma separated value) file as a basic database!

## Reading 
Check out Chapter 9 of Beginning Ruby. The first few pages are on file writing and reading and are worthwhile to know. What we're really interested in is the Text File Databases section starting on page 222.

## A Full Application Using CSV Storage
TODO: This might be a good place to reference some of the JSL lessons, either self-writing ActiveRecord or something a bit easier.
