##Test first: TDD
  Writing tests before implementing features helps developers get the most out of software testing.  Test-first, or test-driven development (TDD) forces developers to think not only about whether their applications are working, but also about how they *should* be working.  Writing tests first defines a functional goal for a particular feature or piece of code.  The "red-green-refactor" development cycle refers to writing a failing test (red), coding a feature that makes your test pass (green), and refactoring as necessary.  Once you get used to test-driven development, this cycle will break your work into managable chunks, and keep you focused on building the software you want.
