## Github pages
There are many ways to get a static HTML and CSS only website up on the internet. Because Github is so central to our work, we'll use a feature of Github called [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) as our method of publishing static pages. Github pages will allow us to quickly publish and iterate our static web pages.

## Daily Deliverables
### Day 1: Basic Webpages
#### Setup
We'll use [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to publish your web pages. Create a directory called <code>html</code> in your projects directory and initialize git. Checkout a `gh-pages` branch (this is the signal that these are pages meant to be rendered via GH Pages). 

#### Exercise 1: Reading Rainbow
- Pick your favorite book and write a "Reading Rainbow" book review web page.
- Create an HTML page titled `reading_rainbow.html`.
- The page should utilize all common HTML tags (html, body, div, p, ul)
- You should have at least one quote from your book, included as a blockquote.
- Have a link to buy the book on amazon, in a new tab.
- Ensure it's up and working on GitHub Pages.

#### Exercise 2: Double Rainbow
- Duplicate your Reading Rainbow book review on a HTML page titled `double_rainbow.html`
- Style your Double Rainbow book review up using a CSS file entitled `double_rainbow.css`
- Go nuts with the style: try different colors, fonts, etc.
- Ensure Double Rainbow is up and working on GitHub Pages.

#### Exercise 3 Partridge Family
- Remake the [Partridge Family](http://derbyimages.woot.com/RobGlenn/Pong_in_the_style_of_De_Stijl-n67ga5-d.jpg) bus design with divs and css, utilizing ids and classes to style each element.

#### Exercise 4: Flight of the Navigator
- Make a static HTML site with a navigation bar
- The site should have 3 pages (home, about, references)
- Each page should be in its own directory - if I visit http://mysite.com/about, I should see your about page)
- Your site should have a static navigation that links to every page from every other page
- Use a grid system 

#### Exercise 5: Contact Form
- Create an HTML-only contact form, including name, email text fields and a text area for the feedback, examples of radio buttons, and checkboxes.
- It should simply submit to the current page. 

#### Exercise 6: Reproduce a Website Fragment
- Go to your favorite website and duplicate one piece of it in pure HTML/CSS.
- Save a screen capture in the same folder.

#### Exercise 7: CSS Zen Garden

#### Exercise 8: SASS Zen Garden

#### Exercise 9: Grid Party
