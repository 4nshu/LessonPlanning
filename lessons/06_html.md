## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is comprised of tags (also called elements) which enclose different parts of a webpage's context. For example, we've seen the `<div>` tag in our rails views. Web browsers read HTML and render visible web pages. When we user hits a Rails application, they never get Ruby code back. The Rails server figures out what to render in HTML, which is what the user always sees. HTML elements are necessary for all websites.

## CSS
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for the look and formatting of a web page. Although styling originally was done in HTML, CSS was created to separate the styling and the content of webpages. Particularly for large applications, CSS management can become pretty burdensome. We'll look at tools and techniques for CSS later in the class.
