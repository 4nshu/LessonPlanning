# Ada Developer's Academy
Ada Developers Academy’s 24 week introduction to web application development is meant to cover both a wide breadth of topics and particular depth into key knowledge areas. At the program’s completion, you will be well on your way to being a proficient web developer, with the tools and skills to build most web applications. 

## What are Web Applications?
Static web sites and Web Applications have little distinction to many people, so what is the difference?. Static web sites are one or more documents that do not change. Examples of this might be your local dentists website, there may be 5 pages displaying a homepage, rates, location, contact, and testimonials. The content typically does not change, and if it does an administrator will update the document on the server. Each individual document is transferred and displayed to the requester. A **Web Application** is software that is hosted on a server, the user requests a page in a similar manor as a static site, but the software receives the request and generates the response dynamically. This can be seen in Facebook, all of the data is stored in a database, and the software determines the most relevant information for the user who is logged, formats the data in HTML and sends the dynamic content back to the web browser. Web Applications are popular because of the ease of use, access, distribution, flexibility, and maintainability over desktop applications. Common examples include:

* Webmail
* eCommerce
* Online Auction
* Wikis
* And many more...

### Development
Web Application software can be written in many ways. Developers will run the code on a local server to be able to quickly test and use the application without the need to deploy code to a remote server. Development is often simplified by using frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and shared between a team using version control software such as Git. Developers will build the software according to specs, user stories, wire frames, and guidelines specified by the project owners. QA and testing play an important role in the development and maintenance of the application.

## Prerequisites
We want to ensure that everyone coming into the class has a similar baseline knowledge. Programming simply takes practice, and the more time you devote to it, the better you’ll be. To that end, please carve out some time to prepare for your first day.

### Assignments
The following assignments are due before the first day of class. ADA mentors will be available during business hours to help with any problems that you encounter.

* Read: [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org)
* Environment Setup - Use the [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org) to download and install the required development tools.
* Create an account and fill out your profile on [Github](Github.com) - [Github.com](http://Github.com) will be an important web service in our program.
* Complete the following online tutorials
    - [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org)
    - [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com)

## Classroom
At ADA we want to provide a learning environment that is comfortable, positive and cram-packed with learning. To do this each day will be structured loosely in the following way:

* **Instruction** - Instruction will be 1-4 hours given by the instructors or a mentor. This is how new topics will be introduced. Students may be asked to install software, follow along, and execute code during the lesson, so be prepared to listen, interact, and ask questions.
* **Assignments** -  Each day students will be given daily assignments to complete. The assignments will be relevant to the day or weeks topics. Each assignment must be completed and submitted to Github by the following morning. The days assignments will range from 1-10 and vary in difficulty depending on the circumstances.
* **Projects** - Starting in week two students will have to complete projects. Projects are larger assignments that will have a variety of issues to address, and allow students to get creative by designing and implementing their own solutions to complex problems. Projects may last anywhere from three days to three weeks depending on complexity. Many projects will be in teams, students will be expected to work with other students by collaborating on code via git and pair programming.  
* **Project Time** - Students will be given time to work on projects in the classroom when applicable. During project time students can ask questions and request the help of at least one available instructor or mentor. Students will be expected to complete projects outside of the class room if the work is not done within the classroom time.
* **Speakers** - Mentors and guest speakers may occasionally be scheduled to lecture on a variety of topics, from technical coding to programming culture.
* **Reading Assignments** - Reading assignments will be given, students are expected to read the material outside of the class room.
* **Review** - Students will occasionally review their progress with the instructors. Instructors will typically schedule reviews every couple of weeks, but students are welcome to request a review at any time.

### Typical Day

* **8am - 10am** - Instruction of new material
* **10 - 10:30** - Daily Assignments explained and given
* **10:30 - 10:45** - Short break
* **10:45 - 12:30** - Continued instruction
* **12:30 - 1:30** - Lunch
* **1:30 - 2:30** - Guest speaker
* **2:30 - Closing** - Project work.
* **4-5** - Review with four students
