## Congratulations!
You've gotten through a LOT of Ruby. Before we move into Rails, you might want to review Appendix A (page 547) for a review of all the main Ruby concepts. It's totally okay if some are still confusing. Just make a note of the things that don't make sense and be sure to come back to them regularly.
