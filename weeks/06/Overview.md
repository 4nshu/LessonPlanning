# Week Six
## Synopsis
We've already worked with HTML a little bit with our Rails views, but up until now, we haven't focused on the design of web application. We're now ready to look at the styling and design of web applications using HTML and CSS. We'll step away from the Rails framework for a bit and look at static pages built with only HTML and CSS. Then, later in the week, we'll apply what we learned to one or two of our existing applications. 

## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is comprised of tags (also called elements) which enclose different parts of a webpage's context. For example, we've seen the <code><div></code> tag in our rails views. Web browsers read HTML and render visible web pages. When we user hits a Rails application, they never get Ruby code back. The Rails server figures out what to render in HTML, which is what the user always sees. HTML elements are necessary for all websites. 
  
## CSS
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for the look and formatting of a web page. Although styling originally was done in HTML, CSS was created to separate the styling and the content of webpages. Particularly for large applications, CSS management can become pretty burdensome. We'll look at tools and techniques for CSS later in the class. 

##Github pages
There are many ways to get a static HTML and CSS only website up on the internet. Because Github is so central to our work, we'll use a feature of Github called [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) as our method of publishing static pages. Github pages will allow us to quickly publish and iterate our static web pages.
