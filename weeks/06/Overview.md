# Week Six
## Synopsis
We've already worked with HTML a little bit with our Rails views, but up until now, we haven't focused on the design of web application. We're now ready to look at the styling and design of web applications using HTML and CSS. We'll step away from the Rails framework for a bit and look at static pages built with only HTML and CSS. Then, later in the week, we'll apply what we learned to one or two of our existing applications. 

## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is comprised of tags (also called elements) which enclose different parts of a webpage's context. For example, we've seen the `<div>` tag in our rails views. Web browsers read HTML and render visible web pages. When we user hits a Rails application, they never get Ruby code back. The Rails server figures out what to render in HTML, which is what the user always sees. HTML elements are necessary for all websites. 

### Basic HTML Lesson Overview

## CSS
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for the look and formatting of a web page. Although styling originally was done in HTML, CSS was created to separate the styling and the content of webpages. Particularly for large applications, CSS management can become pretty burdensome. We'll look at tools and techniques for CSS later in the class. 

### Basic CSS Overview
- Style Tags
- Referencing stylesheets
- Color (hex, names, RGB)
- Fonts 
- Borders
- Floating, clearing, and overflow
- Height/Width (fixed versus percentage, min-widths)
- Display (inline, block, inline-block)
- Backgrounds (urls)
- Resetting and Normalizing CSS

### Introduction to SASS

### Introduction to Twitter Bootstrap

## Github pages
There are many ways to get a static HTML and CSS only website up on the internet. Because Github is so central to our work, we'll use a feature of Github called [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) as our method of publishing static pages. Github pages will allow us to quickly publish and iterate our static web pages.

## Daily Deliverables
### Day 1: Basic Webpages
#### Setup
We'll use [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to publish your web pages. Create a directory called <code>html</code> in your projects directory and initialize git. Checkout a `gh-pages` branch (this is the signal that these are pages meant to be rendered via GH Pages). 

#### Exercise 1: Reading Rainbow
- Pick your favorite book and write a "Reading Rainbow" book review web page.
- Create an HTML page titled `reading_rainbow.html`.
- The page should utilize all common HTML tags (html, body, div, p, ul)
- You should have at least one quote from your book, included as a blockquote.
- Have a link to buy the book on amazon, in a new tab.
- Ensure it's up and working on GitHub Pages.

#### Exercise 2: Double Rainbow
- Duplicate your Reading Rainbow book review on a HTML page titled `double_rainbow.html`
- Style your Double Rainbow book review up using a CSS file entitled `double_rainbow.css`
- Go nuts with the style: try different colors, fonts, etc.
- Ensure Double Rainbow is up and working on GitHub Pages.

#### Exercise 3 Partridge Family
- Remake the [Partridge Family](http://derbyimages.woot.com/RobGlenn/Pong_in_the_style_of_De_Stijl-n67ga5-d.jpg) bus design with divs and css, utilizing ids and classes to style each element.

#### Exercise 4: Flight of the Navigator
- Make a static HTML site with a navigation bar
- The site should have 3 pages (home, about, references)
- Each page should be in its own directory - if I visit http://mysite.com/about, I should see your about page)
- Your site should have a static navigation that links to every page from every other page
- Use a grid system 

#### Exercise 5: Contact Form
- Create an HTML-only contact form, including name, email text fields and a text area for the feedback, examples of radio buttons, and checkboxes.
- It should simply submit to the current page. 

#### Exercise 6: Reproduce a Website Fragment
- Go to your favorite website and duplicate one piece of it in pure HTML/CSS.
- Save a screen capture in the same folder.

#### Exercise 7: CSS Zen Garden

#### Exercise 8: SASS Zen Garden

#### Exercise 9: Grid Party
- Remake your partridge family design by using a grid system. 

#### Exercise 10: Bootstrapping your navigator
- Remove all styling from your Flight of the Navigator assignment. 
- Apply Twitter Bootstrap styles to your page.
