# Week Six
## Synopsis
We've already worked with HTML a little bit with our Rails views, but up until now, we haven't focused on the design of web application. We're now ready to look at the styling and design of web applications using HTML and CSS. We'll step away from the Rails framework for a bit and look at static pages built with only HTML and CSS. Then, later in the week, we'll apply what we learned to one or two of our existing applications.
