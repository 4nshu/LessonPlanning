# Week One
## Bash
Many of the functions and tools needed for Ruby development will be executed from bash

### Tools
Many Command Line tools will be used during ruby development.

### OS X
Terminal.app in OS X is the default bash application.

- `cd [path]` : Change Directory
- `cd ..` : Change Directory (up one directory)
- `mkdir [directory name]` : Make Directory
- `open [file or directory]` : Opens with the prefered application

### Trying Ruby
Ruby can be directly executed in a bash window using IRB (**I**nteractive **R**u**b**y). This can be a helpful tool for learning, quick computations, documentation, and debugging problems. 

TODO: IRB LESSON

- Arithmetic
- Basic string manipulation
- True, False, and Nil
- Arrays

Ruby can also be executed by using a script (file) by using the `ruby` command line tool. In a bash window you can type `ruby -h` to see the usage and a list of options for the `ruby` tool. The most basic usage would be `ruby [filename]`, doing so will execute the contents of the file.

TODO: SCRIPT LESSON

- `puts`
- `if`, `else`, `end`
- blocks: `while` & `each`


```
  
    (2..26).to_a.each do |n|
      File.open("#{n}.md", 'w') do |file|
        file << "DO: Write Week #{n}"
      end
    end
  
```

- user input
- Hashes

### Structure
Understanding the core concepts of programming languages can be the most challenging part. We will spend a good deal of time learning the fundamental ideas and structure that surround the most basic ruby usage. Programming languages can be quite difficult to grasp, not because they over overly complex, but because they are abstract ideas. If we can understand how ruby works we can certainly be more effective in writing ruby code. We will be focusing on:

- Object Orientation: What is an object?
- Classes
- Instances
- Class Methods
- Instance Methods
- Inheritance
- State

### Mastery Quiz

Identify the returned value and class of the returned value for EACH "word" in the following code:

`([1,2,3].reverse.join(" and ")) + "... GO!"`

- [1,2,3] : Array 
- [3,2,1] : Array
- "3 and 2 and 1" : String
- "3 and 2 and 1... GO!" : String

```

    class Person
      def initialize(name, age)
        @name = name
        @age  = age
      end
      
      def name
        @name
      end
  
      def age
        @age
      end
    end
    
    ada = Person.new("Ada Lovelace", 132)
    year_born = Date.today.year - ada.age
    "Ada was born in the year " + year_born
```

## Pairing

Pair programming is a common practice in agile software development. Pair programming is simply 2 people, sitting side-by-side working on the same piece of code on a single computer. Some common reasons for pair programming are:

- Productivity is limited by our minds not our hands
- One person can be editing code while the others mind is looking into future problems and strategic direction
- A more diverse thought process for every problem
- Less "good enough" code
- Both programmers will learn from each others practices

Studies have shown that while pair programming slows down production time (compared to two independent programmers), code quality is increased a non-trivial amount. While pair programming traditionally happens side-by-side, remote pair programming can be accomplished with the use of screen sharing.

Pair programming is a social practice and can present a few hurdles with coordination and cooperation. A couple things to keep in mind:

1. Pair programmers are equals, even if one developer has more experience both developers should be given equal opportunity for input and practice (pair programming and mentor/student programming are much different)
2. If a difference of opinion arises try agreeing on a point of return with one approach, to start the second approach.
3. Everyone's styles and practices are different, if you believe yours is "correct", clearly explain why you think so.
4. Be awesome to your fellow coders

Many employers will require pair programming, even as much as 100% of the time, but typically it is optional. Students will be practicing pair programming for many of the projects during ADA with fellow students, instructors, mentors, and potential employers. 

### Questions

1. Did you find pair programming more productive?

## RubyGems
RubyGems are like little (or sometimes BIG) bundles of Ruby. They can add any and all code to your ruby toolkit. Ruby provides many classes such as Strings, Arrays, Integers, and Hashes, but imagine that you often find yourself using Addresses in Ruby, you could write a gem that encompasses the attributes of an address, bundle it in a gem and reuse it in different application, and distribute it to any one in the world via rubygems.org.
