# Week One

## Ruby In-Depth
Last week, we covered the basics of the Ruby programming language. We'll build upon our knowledge of object-orientation, classes, and methods for our second week.

We will cover the following topics:

## [Object Orientation 2: Attributes and Inheritance](/lessons/02_attributes_inheritance.md)
Setting and getting attributes with `attr_accessor`, class inheritance, plus a side note on string concatenation versus interpolation

## [Flow Control and Iteration](/lessons/02_conditionals_and_loops.md)
Conditionals: `if`, `else`, `elsif`, `unless`, Loops: `while`, `until`

## [Introduction to Methods](/lessons/02_methods.md)
Creating a method, making a custom method for the String class

## [Arrays](/lessons/02_arrays.md)
Creating arrays, adding to and removing from arrays, and iterating through arrays with `.each`

## Homework
Work through Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 in Learn to Program.
