#Week 5: Testing

  There are numerous benefits to testing, but the most obvious is catching mistakes.  Humans make mistakes!  Rails applications are complicated systems with tons of nooks and crannies for your mistakes to hide in.  If you're lucky, your mistakes will keep your application from compiling, and your terminal will display a helpful error.  If you're unlucky, you might spend hours tracking down the causes of an unwanted behavior.  Automated testing saves you time by making your mistakes easier to notice, easier to find, and easier to understand and fix.
